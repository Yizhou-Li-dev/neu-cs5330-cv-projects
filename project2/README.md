[<absolute directory path to image directory>, baseline],
[<absolute directory path to image directory>, rgChromaticity],
[<absolute directory path to image directory>, mrgChromaticity],
[<absolute directory path to image directory>, textureColor],
[<absolute directory path to image directory>, custom]
    Then, run imageComparator's main method and supply one of the following argumennts.
[<absolute directory path to image in image directory>, baseline, sum_of_squared_diff, <number of output image>]
[<absolute directory path to image in image directory>, rgChromaticity, histogram_intersection, <number of output image>]
[<absolute directory path to image in image directory>, mrgChromaticity, histogram_intersection, <number of output image>]
[<absolute directory path to image in image directory>, textureColor, histogram_intersection, <number of output image>]
[<absolute directory path to image in image directory>, custom, histogram_intersection, <number of output image>]
the final results will show in the terminal.
