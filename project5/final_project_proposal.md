# Final Project Proposal

We want to explore the project from Professor Amanda Welsh, about developing a model to classify the 6k images according to the amount of plastic in them.

We need to observe the dataset features before deciding the detailed plan about experiments. However, the initial idea for this project is:

1. Using some one-class classification methods to identify the no-product images.
2. Build a new model to classify the images about the amount of plastic.

We will compare some SOTA methods in each steps and try to find a best accuracy solution for the problem.
