1. A short description of the overall project in your own words. (200 words or less)
This project explores real time object recognition technique. It prerecords different objects' features into database file, and compute the object's feature in front of the camera. Finally, use classification methods such as KNN to decide the closest images that object is.

2. Any required images along with a short description of the meaning of the image.
It will be included in submissions.

3. A description and example images of any extensions.
It will be included in submissions.

4. A short reflection of what you learned.
I learned ways to threshold the images, do connected component analysis, and using classification methods to understand the image itself

5. Acknowledgement of any materials or people you consulted for the assignment.
I counsulted TA, and the professor's lecture notes
